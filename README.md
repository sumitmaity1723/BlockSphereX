- **Profile Update:** Registered users can modify or update their profile securely.
- **Data Transparency:** All user profiles are publicly accessible via blockchain lookup.
- **Event Tracking:** Every registration and update emits an event for transparency.

## 🔮 Future Scope
- Integration with **Decentralized Identity (DID)** systems.
- Support for **KYC and verified credentials** using oracles.
- Implementation of **NFT-based identity badges**.
- Expansion to **multi-chain identity interoperability**.
